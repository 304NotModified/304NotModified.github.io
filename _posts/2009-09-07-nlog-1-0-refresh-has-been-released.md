title: NLog 1.0 Refresh has been released
---

This is a re-release of NLog 1.0 extended to support Visual Studio 2008 and 2010 Beta using updated installer.
No source code changes have been made since 1.0 and the version number matches 1.0 to ensure binary compatiblity. Project structure has been cleaned up to make it easier to build without 3rd party tools.

title: NLog 3.0 has been released
---

At long last NLog 3.0 has been released, and is available at [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NLog/ "NuGet - NLog"), the binaries is available at [GitHub release page](https://github.com/NLog/NLog/releases/tag/v3.0 "GitHub release page").

As warned in about in the [last post](http://nlog-project.org/2013/12/14/nlog-3-0-will-soon-be-released.html "NLog 3.0 will soon be released"), support for the following frameworks have been dropped:

 * Compact Framework (all versions)
 * Silverlight 2 and 3
 * .NET 2.0
 * COM Interop
 * NLogC

The reason for this can be read in the former post.

Other than that this release contains bug alot of bug fixes, and the full change log can be found at the [Github issue page](https://github.com/NLog/NLog/issues?milestone=3&state=closed "Github issue page - NLog 3.0").

After the new build server has been configurated, the release cycle for NLog will be alot faster, so more and smaller releases should be expected in the future.

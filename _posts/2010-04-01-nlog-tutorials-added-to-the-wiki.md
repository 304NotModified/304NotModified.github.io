title: NLog tutorials added to the Wiki
---

I did a web search today looking for 3rd-party NLog tutorials and Iâ€™ve put some of the links on the [NLog Wiki](https://github.com/NLog/NLog/wiki). Some of the articles I found are pretty advanced, and they showcase how NLog can be a part of modern application architectures using AOP, dependency injection and other good engineering techniques.

Enjoy.

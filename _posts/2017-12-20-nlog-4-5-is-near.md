## What happend to NLog 5?

We started with NLog 5 almost two years ago, in the time of DNX and dotnet5.4. 
Fast forward, the branch we were building on is heavily diverged and we were maintaining two versions of NLog! (NLog 4 and NLog 5).
Almost every file had been changed in NLog 5 and with multiple migrations (DNX, project.json, csproj), 
it was clear that merging the NLog 5 branch into master was too tricky! 

With the completion of .NET Standard 2, it was easier to move in smaller steps to the new platforms (including .NET standard 1) and we have ported 
the most important stuff to NLog 4.5

This means that NLog 4.5 will have the support for the platforms added in NLog 5, thus making NLog 5 obsolete!

The best part, there are no breaking changes between NLog 4.x and NLog 4.5! (we take semver very serious!)

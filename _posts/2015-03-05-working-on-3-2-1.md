title: We are working on 3.2.1
---

To fix some small issues (submitted on GitHub - thanks), we are working on 3.2.1. This release will contain two bugfixes:

- The stacktrace was broken under specific conditions. This was introduced with the "skip assembly" feature.
- The `LogManager.Configuration.Variables` property wasn't implemented in the correct class. 


Full details are [available on GitHub](https://github.com/NLog/NLog/milestones/3.2.1).

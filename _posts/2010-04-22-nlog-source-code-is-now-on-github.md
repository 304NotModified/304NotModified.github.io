title: NLog source code is now on GitHub
---

NLog source repository can now be found on GitHub, [http://github.com/NLog/NLog](http://github.com/NLog/NLog)

I have also taken a snapshot of NLogViewer and put it there as well, [http://github.com/jkowalski/NLogViewer](http://github.com/jkowalski/NLogViewer).

As mentioned earlier, NLogViewer is no longer maintained, so feel free to fork the source code and evolve it on GitHub.

Note that since I'm still learning Git, I'm not retiring Subversion server just yet and will use it for backup in case I mess something up.

**UPDATE**: My original import turned out to be little messed up, so I deleted it and re-uploaded everything from scratch, this time with proper branch/tag structure. I'm starting to really like Git now that I understand it a little better...

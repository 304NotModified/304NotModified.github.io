title: NLog 4.2.0 is here!
---

NLog 4.2.0 has been released. This release contains some small feature, (important) bug fixes and new collaborators

We take [semver](http://semver.org/) serious, so all changes are backwards-compatible. 

##Features
- nlog.web and nlog.windows.forms released to 4.0
- Main feature: strong naming.
- Performance Counter Target: it's now possible to configure increment step for the counter. Before it was always 1.
- Mail Target: `pickupDirectoryLocation` and `deliveryMethod` are configurable from the NLog config.
- Cached Layout Renderer: a `clearCache` option has been added for more control when to clear the cache. See [wiki](https://github.com/NLog/NLog/wiki/Cached-Layout-Renderer). 


##Bug fixes

###Inner layout can now contain colons
An inner layout can now contain colons, but it needs an escape.

We need to escape `:` and `}` in an inner layout because: 

- `:` because it's a value separator. `${when:when=1 == 1:Inner=Test\: Hello}`
- `}` because it's it can be the end of another layout renderer when double nested.  `${rot13:inner=${rot13:inner=${when:when=1 == 1:Inner=Test \} Hello}}}`


###Other bugfixes

- Mail Target: when `useSystemNetMailSettings` was `false`, still some settings were used from the `<mailSettings>` from the .Net config.
- Removed unneeded System.Drawing references for Xamarin.
- File Target: Sometimes exception thrown when archiving is enabled.
- File Target: file archiving DateAndSequence & FileArchivePeriod.Day won't work always.
- GetTargetsByLevelForLogger could throw a "Collection was modified" exception. 


##No bug nor feature 

- Improve documentation when creating Loggers using `Getcurrentclasslogger` and `GetLogger`; Regarding `type` argument, please keep in mind:

>  - It expects it inherits from `Logger`
>  - Instead of creating an instance of `Logger`, it will create an instance of `loggerType`
>  - `type` argument needed when using custom Loggers. Most of the time it isn't needed to pass a type to those methods.

- We improved other docs and internal logging in the code. And increase our code coverage.

title: Improved support; closing the forum, removing news post comments
---
As NLog contributors we consider it is important that users can easily contact us for questions, feature request and relevant discussions. At the moment these  possibilities are scattered across multiple places: GitHub, Google groups and the news page. 
In order to improve the response time and maintain a better overview, we are going to:

-	Close the Google Group
-	Remove the comment section under the news posts. 

Questions, feature request and even discussions should be posted on the [GitHub issue list](https://github.com/NLog/NLog/issues) . If you have any open issues, please submit those again on GitHub!
We expect this to be an improvement for both users and contributors of NLog! Less is more :)

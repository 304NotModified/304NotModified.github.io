title: NLog 4.0 - Roadmap and release date
---

With the upcoming release of 4.0, we're doing some things differently: 
we are time-boxing the release and so the release date is now already known: June 2nd, 2015, a year after the release of 3.0!

Issues for 4.0 are now prioritized with the  [MoSCoW method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_method). In short this means:

 - We will label the issues with *Must have*, *Should have*, *Could have* and *Wont have this time around* 
 - The release **must** contain the *must haves*. We will move the release date if not all must haves are implemented. 
 - The release should contain the *should haves*. But we will release even if not all should haves are implemented.
 - Could haves would be nice, but only if we have enough time, according to the planned release date. 
 
The roadmap of 4.0:

* [5 must haves](https://github.com/NLog/NLog/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A4.0+label%3A%22Must+have%22)
* [7 should haves](https://github.com/NLog/NLog/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A4.0+label%3A%22Should+have%22+)
* [10 could haves](https://github.com/NLog/NLog/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A4.0+label%3A%22Could+have%22+)
* [Total list](https://github.com/NLog/NLog/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=milestone%3A4.0)


Please note that "pull requests" (PR's) that are accepted a week before release, are also released with 4.0! 



I would also like to emphasize that NLog is a fully open source project. So also the roadmap and internal discussions are open. 
If you're interested in the NLog process and discussions, just look at the [discussion at the Github issues list](https://github.com/NLog/NLog/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Adiscussion)
